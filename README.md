# How-to-build-a-social-computer
This repository contains the project files of the Virtual Body Double project from the How to Build a Social Computer seminar.

The "YallahUnityProject" folder contains the unity project with the YALLAH agent and its environment. This folder needs to be opened and run in unity. Alternatively, a link to a pre-build executable is here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uxnL9_2H4l69QvmpZ6bgNa2xljZXXZJ6?usp=drive_link). For voice output, MaryTTS needs to be installed.

Note that the project and executable were build for windows, which may lead to issues in regard to other OS.

The "VSM project file" folder contains the VSM project files. This project has the studymaster and yallah plugin already set up. To run it open it in VSM and press run.

Both the unity project and the vsm project must be run in parralel to see the result of our project. As soon as both run at the same time, the YALLAH agent should start to display its default behavior. To trigger empathic reactions, the studymaster webpage must be reached(starts automatically with the VSM project). The studymaster can then be reached under localhost:8080 to trigger the empathic reactions of the agent.
