This repo contains the project files used in the >Virtual Body Double Project of the How to build a Social Computer seminar.

The YallahUnityProject folder is the unity project. Containing the Yallah agent and its enviroment. This folder needs to be opened and run in unity. Alternativly a link to a pre build executable is here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uxnL9_2H4l69QvmpZ6bgNa2xljZXXZJ6?usp=drive_link). 

Note that the project and executable where build for windows, which may lead to issues in regards to other OS.

The "VSM project file" folder contains the VSM project files. This project has the studymaster and yallah plugin already set up. To run it open it in VSM and press run.

Both the unity project and the vsm project must be run in parralel to see the result of our project. The studymaster can then be reached under localhost:8080 to trigger the empathic reactions of the agent.
